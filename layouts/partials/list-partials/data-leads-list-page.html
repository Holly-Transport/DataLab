        <p class="data-leads-description">Data Lab Leads are director-nominated focal points for teams across
          all VPUs, tasked with linking their colleagues who are seeking data-related resources to the other
          Lab Leads. Through this system, teams can be connected to the data resources they need, while
          avoiding the need to set up a centralized “help desk”. Lab Leads also contribute towards Lab program
          design and implementation, and they meet monthly to share and learn best practices.

      <p>
        Lab Leads are among the most technically current, well connected
        staff in their units.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lab Leads can use the Lab as a platform to launch large initiatives,
        from high-level partnerships to clinics and crowdfunding new ideas
        - activities that would be more difficult given each Lead’s
        limitations posed by their sector or region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lab Leads are supported by the <a href="{{- .Site.BaseURL -}}{{- .Site.Params.DataResourcesLink -}}">Who-Does-What Directory</a> - the
        World Bank’s first comprehensive mapping effort for data and
        geospatial resources.
