			<p class="data-fellows-description">Data Lab Leads are director-nominated focal points for teams across all VPUs, tasked with linking their colleagues who are seeking data-related resources to the other Lab Leads. Through this system, teams can be connected to the data resources they need, while avoiding the need to set up a centralized “help desk”.  Lab Leads also contribute towards Lab program design and implementation, and they meet monthly to share and learn best practices.
