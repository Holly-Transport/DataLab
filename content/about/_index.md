The WB Data Lab is a community of practice for colleagues seeking to modernize project data practices through learning, networking, and shared resources.

Lab members are eager to learn, build new skills, and support each other.

This is your platform for testing and scaling big ideas. Want to crowdfund something? Got a great SDG or ESF indicator method to test? Want to form a partnership? Organize a training? This is your network.

The Lab is also your chance to meet colleagues across the organization -- from DEC, ITS, and our Global Practices -- through engaging activities.
