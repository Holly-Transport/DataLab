Climacell combines traditional weather sensor data with non-traditional sources to derive up-to-the minute, real time micro weather and air quality mapping and forecasts. There service is used primarily by utilities and transportation companies, like Uber and Ford, and airlines, such as JetBlue, United, and Delta. The workshop focused on the Bank's response to the locust crisis in east Africa as a case study, but discussion and questions covered all manner of challenges -- transport, agriculture, industry, etc.
