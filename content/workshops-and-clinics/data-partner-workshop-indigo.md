We are very excited to introduce our newest Development Data Partnership member, Indigo. Through Indigo's Atlas platform, users can access high-resolution, real-time data on crop location and health, impact of weather on crops, and more. During this introductory workshop, we learned about and discussed how we can make the most of this new platform.
