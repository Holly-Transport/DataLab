Spice up your next mission with modern data collection methods. First, learn how to capture street view images(spoiler alert - it's easy) and then how to use these images to support project monitoring (even in FCVs), RAP development, DRM risk assessments, road safety assessments, and more. Then, learn how your colleagues are training clients to collect geo-tagged data for project monitoring. The session will wrap up with a show-and-tell table, with a selection of data collection tools and apps you can try (sub-text: come in person - it'll be informative + fun)!
